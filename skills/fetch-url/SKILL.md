# Fetch URL

Retrieve content from any web page or API endpoint with mode-specific post-processing.

## Modes

- **`read`** (default) — Extract main article content as markdown using trafilatura. Best for articles, blog posts, and documentation. Strips navigation, ads, and boilerplate.
- **`read_full`** — Convert the entire page to markdown including navigation and sidebars. Use when you need the full page context (e.g., docs with sidebar TOC).
- **`links`** — Extract all hyperlinks from the page as a markdown list. Use to discover URLs for further fetching.
- **`raw`** — Return the response body exactly as received from the server, with no formatting or JSON pretty-printing. Use when you need byte-exact output (e.g., verifying signatures, parsing minified JSON yourself, or preserving whitespace).

## Security

- Only `http://` and `https://` URLs are allowed
- Private/internal IP ranges are blocked (SSRF protection)
- Response size capped at 5MB
- Redirects followed manually, up to 5 hops, each re-validated
- Output truncated at 50,000 characters

## Content type handling

- `text/html` → processed per selected mode
- `application/json` → pretty-printed (except in `raw` mode, where the exact server response is returned)
- Other `text/*` → passed through as-is
- Binary content → rejected with a descriptive message
